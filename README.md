# Predicting Bitcoin Evolution and Braga Accidents using Deep Learning

This repository contains an academic work aimed at predicting the evolution of Bitcoin prices and predicting accidents in the city of Braga using deep learning techniques, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The field of financial prediction is a challenging and dynamic area, and the use of deep learning methods has proven to be an effective tool in making accurate predictions. In this work, we apply LSTMs, GRUs, and CNNs to historical Bitcoin price data to predict future prices, and this work is presented in Jupyter notebooks.

Similarly, the prediction of accidents is a crucial problem for cities, as it helps to allocate resources and prevent incidents. In this work, we apply deep learning techniques to a dataset of accidents in the city of Braga to predict future accidents in the region, and this work is also presented in Jupyter notebooks.

This work showcases the potential of deep learning in financial prediction and accident prediction and provides a framework for future research in these areas.
